# Diamonds-ANOVA-Analysis
 This project analyzes the relationship between diamond prices and their color grades and cuts using one-way and two-way ANOVA in Python. By comparing price distributions across different diamond categories, the study determines whether statistically significant differences exist and identifies specific pairwise variations using Tukey's HSD post hoc tests. Leveraging libraries such as pandas, statsmodels, and Seaborn, the analysis provides data-driven insights into how diamond characteristics influence pricing, offering valuable guidance for buyers and sellers in the diamond market.
